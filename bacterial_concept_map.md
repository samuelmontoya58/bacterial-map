# Conceptual Map: Bacterial Groups and Diseases

## Spirochetes
- **Characteristics**: Helical, gram-negative, heterotrophic, move using internal flagella.
- **Example Disease**: Lyme disease
  - *Pathogen*: *Borrelia burgdorferi*
  - *Symptoms*: Rash, fever, fatigue, joint pain

## Proteobacteria
- **Characteristics**: Highly diverse; includes autotrophs, heterotrophs, and pathogens.
- **Example Disease**: Cholera
  - *Pathogen*: *Vibrio cholerae*
  - *Symptoms*: Severe diarrhea, dehydration

## Cyanobacteria
- **Characteristics**: Gram-negative, photosynthetic, oxygen-producing, found in aquatic environments.
- **Example Disease**: No direct human disease, but some produce harmful algal blooms that release toxins.

## Chlamydias
- **Characteristics**: Obligate intracellular parasites, gram-negative, lack peptidoglycan.
- **Example Disease**: Chlamydia (STI)
  - *Pathogen*: *Chlamydia trachomatis*
  - *Symptoms*: Genital pain, discharge, potential infertility

## Gram-Positive Bacteria
- **Characteristics**: Thick peptidoglycan walls, some form spores, includes beneficial and harmful species.
- **Example Disease**: Tuberculosis
  - *Pathogen*: *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*
  - *Symptoms*: Chronic cough, weight loss, night sweats

### Instructions for Handwritten Concept Map:
1. Draw a central node labeled **Bacterial Groups**.
2. Branch out to each of the five main groups listed above.
3. From each group, create sub-branches for characteristics and example diseases.
4. Illustrate bacteria with simple drawings (e.g., spirals for spirochetes, rods for bacilli, etc.).
5. Use colors to differentiate groups.
6. Ensure clarity by organizing connections logically and labeling everything clearly.
